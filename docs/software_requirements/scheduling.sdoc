TITLE: Thread Scheduling Algorithm

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: ZEP-SRS-23-001
STATUS: Active
TYPE: Functional
COMPONENT: Scheduling
TITLE: Priority-Based Selection
STATEMENT: >>>
The Zephyr RTOS shall select the highest priority ready thread as the current thread from the ready queue.
<<<

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: ZEP-SRS-23-002
STATUS: Active
TYPE: Functional
COMPONENT: Scheduling
TITLE: Deadline Enforcement (EDF)
STATEMENT: >>>
When earliest-deadline-first (EDF) scheduling is enabled, the Zephyr RTOS shall prioritize threads with equal static priority based on earliest deadline.
<<<

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: ZEP-SRS-23-003
STATUS: Active
TYPE: Non-Functional
COMPONENT: Scheduling
TITLE: Ready Queue Scalability
STATEMENT: >>>
The Zephyr RTOS shall support configurable ready queue implementations.

[SECTION]
TITLE: Reschedule Points

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: ZEP-SRS-23-004
STATUS: Active
TYPE: Functional
COMPONENT: Scheduling
TITLE: Mandatory Context Switch Triggers
STATEMENT: >>>
The Zephyr RTOS shall trigger rescheduling during: thread state transitions (→SUSPENDED/WAITING), ISR returns, explicit k_yield() calls, and time slice expiration.
<<<

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: ZEP-SRS-23-005
STATUS: Active
TYPE: Functional
COMPONENT: Scheduling
TITLE: Atomic Rescheduling
STATEMENT: >>>
The Zephyr RTOS shall perform rescheduling atomically at designated points to prevent partial state corruption during thread swaps.
<<<

[SECTION]
TITLE: Thread States and Priorities

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: ZEP-SRS-23-006
STATUS: Active
TYPE: Functional
COMPONENT: Scheduling
TITLE: Cooperative Thread Non-Preemption
STATEMENT: >>>
The Zephyr RTOS shall ensure Cooperative threads (negative priority) retain execution until explicitly yielding or entering unready state.
<<<

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: ZEP-SRS-23-007
STATUS: Active
TYPE: Functional
COMPONENT: Scheduling
TITLE: Preemptive Thread Interruption
STATEMENT: >>>
The Zephyr RTOS shall allow Preemptive threads (≥0 priority) to be interrupted immediately by higher-priority ready threads.
<<<

[/SECTION]

[SECTION]
TITLE: Time Slicing

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: ZEP-SRS-23-008
STATUS: Active
TYPE: Functional
COMPONENT: Scheduling
TITLE: Cooperative Voluntary Yielding
STATEMENT: >>>
The Zephyr RTOS shall provide a mechanism for Cooperative threads to allow equal/higher priority threads to execute before resuming.
<<<

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: ZEP-SRS-23-009
STATUS: Active
TYPE: Functional
COMPONENT: Scheduling
TITLE: Preemptive Time Quantum
STATEMENT: >>>
The Zephyr RTOS shall ensure Preemptive threads relinquish CPU after a configurable time slice (system ticks) if equal-priority threads are ready.
<<<

[/SECTION]

[SECTION]
TITLE: Zephyr RTOS Locking

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: ZEP-SRS-23-010
STATUS: Active
TYPE: Functional
COMPONENT: Scheduling
TITLE: Non-Preemptible Critical Sections
STATEMENT: >>>
The Zephyr RTOS shall provide a mechanism to treat preemptive threads as cooperative until a unlock function is called.
<<<

[/SECTION]

[SECTION]
TITLE: Thread Management

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: ZEP-SRS-23-011
STATUS: Active
TYPE: Functional
COMPONENT: Scheduling
TITLE: Thread Sleeping
STATEMENT: >>>
The Zephyr RTOS shall provide a mechanism to delay thread execution within ±1 tick of requested duration.
<<<

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: ZEP-SRS-23-011
STATUS: Active
TYPE: Functional
COMPONENT: Scheduling
TITLE: Thread Waking
STATEMENT: >>>
The Zephyr RTOS shall provide a mechanism to for a thread to wake another thread. Note: A wakeup can be attempted on a thread that is already awake - this has no effect.
<<<

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: ZEP-SRS-23-012
STATUS: Active
TYPE: Functional
COMPONENT: Scheduling
TITLE: Busy Wait Non-Relinquishing
STATEMENT: >>>
The Zephyr RTOS shall provide a mechanism to perform a busy wait where the Zephyr RTOS will not yield CPU or trigger rescheduling during delay.
<<<

[/SECTION]

TITLE: SMP Considerations

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: ZEP-SRS-23-013
STATUS: Active
TYPE: Functional
COMPONENT: Scheduling
TITLE: Affinity Awareness

STATUS: Active
TYPE: Functional
COMPONENT: Scheduling
TITLE: Cross-CPU Atomicity
STATEMENT: >>>
The Zephyr RTOS shall ensure that Spinlocks enforce cross-CPU mutual exclusion for Zephyr RTOS data structures.
<<<
