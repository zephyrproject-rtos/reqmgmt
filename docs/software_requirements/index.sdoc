TITLE: Data Passing

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: ZEP-89
STATUS: Draft
TYPE: Functional
COMPONENT: Data Passing
TITLE: Traditional FIFO Queue
STATEMENT: >>>
The Zephyr RTOS shall provide a kernel object that implements a traditional first in, first out (FIFO) queue, allowing threads and ISRs to add and remove a limited number of 32-bit data values.
<<<
USER_STORY: >>>
As a Zephyr RTOS user I want to be able to exchange 1 to N data objects between different threads and ISR in a thread-safe manner with a first-in-first-out (queue) behaviour.
<<<

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: ZEP-90
STATUS: Draft
TYPE: Functional
COMPONENT: Data Passing
TITLE: Traditional LIFO queue

TITLE: Mutex

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: ZEP-91
STATUS: Draft
TYPE: Functional
COMPONENT: Mutex
TITLE: Mutex Kernel Object
STATEMENT: >>>
The Zephyr RTOS shall support resource synchronization. (Note synchronization can be for memory access, and mutex may be one implementation, but not the only one).
<<<
USER_STORY: >>>
As a Zephyr RTOS user I want to be able to sychonize threads when accessing common resources, where the thread shall have the option to:
- wait eternally until the resources becomes available.
- immediately return with a negative message if the resource is not available and allow the thread to continue.
- wait for a given time for the resource to become available or return with a negative message.
<<<
REVIEW_COMMENT: >>>
Concern over phrase recursive.  What is it MUTEXing? Memory Management?

and a receiving thread to be able to retrieve the message at its convenience. This
allows for asynchronous communication, where threads do not need to synchronize their
execution explicitly.
