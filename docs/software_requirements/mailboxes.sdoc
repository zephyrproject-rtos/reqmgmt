TITLE: Synchronous Message Sending
STATEMENT: >>>
The Zephyr RTOS shall provide a mechanism for a thread to send a message through a mailbox and block until the message is processed or a timeout occurs.
<<<
USER_STORY: >>>
As a Zephyr RTOS developer, I want to be able to send a message and wait for it to be processed so that I can be sure the message was received before continuing execution.

<<<
USER_STORY: >>>
As a Zephyr RTOS developer, I want to be able to limit how long my thread waits for a message to be received so that I can implement fallback behavior if communication takes too long.

STATUS: Draft
TYPE: Functional
COMPONENT: Mailboxes
TITLE: Asynchronous Completion Signaling
STATEMENT: >>>
When a sending thread asynchronously sends a message to a mailbox object, the Zephyr RTOS shall provide a mechanism to signal to the sending thread that the message has been both received and completely processed by the receiver.
<<<
USER_STORY: >>>
As a Zephyr RTOS developer, I want to be notified when my asynchronously sent message has been fully processed so that I can perform follow-up actions without polling.
