[REQUIREMENT]
UID: ZEP-1
STATUS: Draft
TYPE: High Level
COMPONENT: Hardware Architecture Interface
TITLE: Architecture Layer Interface
STATEMENT: >>>
The Zephyr RTOS shall provide a framework to communicate with a set of hardware architectural services.
<<<
USER_STORY: >>>
As a Zephyr RTOS user I want to be able to easily switch my application to a different MCU architecture (x86, ARM Cortex-M/A, RISCV etc.).
<<<

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: ZEP-3
STATUS: Draft
TYPE: High Level
COMPONENT: Hardware Architecture Interface
TITLE: Support multiprocessor management
STATEMENT: >>>
The Zephyr RTOS shall support symmetric multiprocessing on multiple cores.
<<<
USER_STORY: >>>
As a Zephyr RTOS user I want to use Zephyr OS on multi core (SMP-)MCUs/MPUs.
<<<
REVIEW_COMMENT: >>>
From the Docs: No special application code needs to be written to take advantage of this feature
<<<
RELATIONS:
- TYPE: Parent
  VALUE: ZEP-1

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: ZEP-2
STATUS: Draft
TYPE: High Level
COMPONENT: C Library
TITLE: Support Subset of Standard C Library
STATEMENT: >>>
The Zephyr RTOS shall support a subset of the standard C library.
<<<
USER_STORY: >>>
As a Zephyr RTOS user I want to have a selection of standard C library implementations e.g. a full extend and a minimal with a smaller footprint or a particular fast executing implementation.
<<<
REVIEW_COMMENT: >>>
Can we limit the type of C library implementations? Testing might be hell if we do not limit ourselves to the ones defined? Like "minimal libc" and "newlib". Will it make sense to pull minimal Libc into the certification scope?

Clarification: Would prefer to cover the scope part first. Talking about the hooks which apply to each C Library. Open, Close, Diff. Hooks that are OS dependent. C or Library dependent. ref https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/main/lib/libc/newlib/libc-hooks.c

TBD: The requirement needs refinement.

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: ZEP-36

TYPE: High Level
COMPONENT: Device Drivers
TITLE: Device Driver Abstraction
STATEMENT: >>>
The Zephyr RTOS shall provide a framework for managing device drivers and peripherals.

As a Zephyr RTOS user I want my application to be portable between different MCU architectures (ARM Cortex-M/A, Intel x86, RISCV etc.) and MCU vendors (STM, NXP, Intel, etc.) without having to change the MCU peripherals access.
<<<
REVIEW_COMMENT: >>>
TBD: Title seems to need refinement. Also, this requirement's user story seems to be identical to that of ZEP-1.
<<<

STATUS: Draft
TYPE: High Level
COMPONENT: Logging
TITLE: Logging
STATEMENT: >>>
The Zephyr RTOS shall provide a framework for logging events.
<<<
USER_STORY: >>>
As a Zephyr RTOS user I want to be able to log application defined events as well as framework exceptions.
<<<
REVIEW_COMMENT: >>>
Nicole: TBD: we need to have logging in the safety scope?
<<<

UID: ZEP-41
STATUS: Draft
TYPE: High Level
COMPONENT: Memory Management
TITLE: Memory Management framework
STATEMENT: >>>
The Zephyr RTOS shall support a memory management framework.
<<<
USER_STORY: >>>
As a Zephyr RTOS user I want memory to be allocated and protected to my application threads preventing mistakenly access to foreign memory as far as the hardware allows.
<<<

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: ZEP-42
STATUS: Draft
TYPE: High Level
COMPONENT: Power Management
TITLE: Power Management
STATEMENT: >>>
The Zephyr RTOS shall provide an interface to control hardware power states.
<<<
USER_STORY: >>>
As a Zephyr RTOS user I want to be able to control the power mode of the MCU and its peripherals to take advantage of the hardware features and to be able to implement low power or battery driven long life applications.
<<<
